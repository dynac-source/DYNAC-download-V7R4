Additions, modifications and corrections for DGUI V2R7 (28-Dec-2024)
==================================================================================
## ADDITIONS ##
 1. Added the more recent MAC OS names (shown when clicking on "About" and then
    "List software versions")

## MODIFICATIONS ##
 1. When you use DGUI to run DYNAC, you now need to include the full path to files
    listed in the DYNAC input file(s). Examples are: 
      -the distribution file listed after the GEBEAM card
      -the solenoid field file listed after the FSOLE card 
      -the RFQ description file listed after the RFQPTQ card (and possible RMS and
       FF field file names referred to from within the RFQ description file).
      -the field description file listed after the FIELD card (e.g. used in 
       combination with CAVNUM)
 2. In more recent versions of python3 regular expressions have to be explicitly
    listed as such (not doing so is deprecated and will give a warning). DGUI
    has been updated accordingly.

## CORRECTIONS ##
 1. None 

==================================================================================
Additions, modifications and corrections for DGUI V2R6 (15-Aug-2024)
==================================================================================
## ADDITIONS ##
 1. The path towards the location of the last plotted ditribution file is now
    automatically saved in the dgui.ini file. This was already done for the
    location of the last used input file and the last used project.

 2. Clarification in the DGUI_UG as to where the dgui.ini file would need to 
    be placed in the case of a multi-user dynac environment. Note that the
    path to the location of the dgui.ini file needs to be given as argument (behind
    -p) when opening dgui.py

3. The available aperture (as set by the REJECT card) can now also be plotted. Note
   that this requires DYNAC V7R3 or newer. If no aperture was defined in the dynac 
   input file, a default value of 100 cm will be taken.

4. From the "Help" menu, in addition to opening PDF User Guides, one can select
   a DYNAC Type Code directly, in order to get information on the selected Type
   Code.

## MODIFICATIONS ##
 1. Updated some calls to some Python libraries to be consistent with most recent 
    versions of these libraries, whilst remaining backward compatible with older 
    libraries.

## CORRECTIONS ##
 1. Erroneous call to Tkinter removed; Tkinter no longer imported as a library. 
    Call replaced by call to equivalent Qt funtion.
 2. Selecting a different color map in the Options window did not work for all 
    color maps. This has been corrected.

Additions, modifications and corrections for DGUI V2R4 (06-Jan-2024)
==================================================================================
## ADDITIONS ##
 1.   One can interrupt DYNAC execution by clicking "Run DYNAC" a second time.
 2.   Versions of software associated with DGUI can by listed from options menu.

## MODIFICATIONS ##
 1. Update to how dynac.print is read (due to added columns in this file; see
    DYNAC UG).

==================================================================================
Additions, modifications and corrections for DGUI V2R3 (30-Oct-2021)
==================================================================================
## ADDITIONS ##
 1.   Plot of beam losses  
 2.   When closing dgui (use close button), path to last used input file will be saved
 3.   Steering correctors are now also shown when plotting envelopes with beam line
      elements and are marked with the letter C (requires dynac source V7R2 or more
      recent).
 4.   Added options that enables the user to store the (gnu)plots created with plotit as
      well as the other plots as png or jpeg files.
 5.   Creation of a project directory, storage of files in the selected project directory.
      See user guide for details.
 6.   xreader is now the default for opening the User Guides (PDF) on linux, but acrobat
      is still supported. See user guide for details.

 
## MODIFICATIONS ##
 1.   Changed main titles of plots to have slightly larger font. The background
      of the distribution plot window is white now. 
 2.   Improved logging of information in large text box in main window, including of
      actions originating from the options window. 
 3.   The way one can close DGUI has been cleaned up. In the "File" drop down menu (left
      top), you can either "Close DGUI" or "Close all windows". If one clicks on 
      "Close DGUI", the DGUI window and the DGUI options window (if present), will be
      closed, but any graphics windows will be allowed to persist. Clicking on
      "Close all windows" will have the same effect as "Close DGUI", but all graphics
      windows that are open will be closed as well. Clicking on the X (right top corner
      of the DGUI window) has the same effect as "Close all windows". 

## CORRECTIONS ##
 1.   The automatic scaling for the transverse "Ext" envelope plots did not work 
      properly for the case where the abs(minimum value) was larger than the
      maximum value. This has been corrected.
 2.   In some cases the last horizontal tick label of the distribution plots could
      be cut off; now there is more space for these labels. 

# DELETIONS ## 
 1.   None

==================================================================================
Additions, modifications and corrections for DGUI V2R2 (1-May-2020)
==================================================================================
## ADDITIONS ##
 1.   In the options window one can now choose from different colormaps for 
      distribution plots. These are used when making density plots. One can change
      the colormap (for a single session) in the options window, or one can set the
      user preferred colormap in the dgui.ini file. The colorbar was already 
      visible in the options window, but now it is also visible in the window
      containing the density plots. An additional library (colorcet) needs to be 
      installed (e.g. with pip) before you can use this new revision of DGUI. See 
      the DGUI User Guide for more details. 
 2.   User defined limits for distribution plots can now also be set via the 
      options window.
 3.   The RMS emittance values can optionally be printed in the distribtuion plots.
 4.   The density plots now also have a colorbar added.
 5.   Optionally beam line elements are plotted in the envelope plot.
 
## MODIFICATIONS ##
 1.   The default dynac binary has been changed from dynacv6_0 to dynacv7. If
      dynacv6_0 is nevertheless preferred, one can either change this (for a single
      session) in the options window, or one can set the user preferred binary
      as default in the dgui.ini file. See the DGUI User Guide for more details.
 2.   DGUI now retains the last used input file path within a session, as well as the 
      last used distribution file path within a session.
 3.   The background color of the options window was changed in order to improve
      readability of the labels on the window.

## CORRECTIONS ##
 1.   None

# DELETIONS ## 
 1.   None

==================================================================================
Additions, modifications and corrections for DGUI V2R1 (1-May-2019)
==================================================================================
## ADDITIONS ##
 1.   In the "DYNAC GUI Options" window one can now change the DYNAC binary DGUI
      is to use. See the DGUI UG for more details.
 2.   One can now also plot the beam centroid and transmission; see the DGUI UG
      for more details.
 3.   Execution of DYNAC can now be interrupted by typing ctrl-I (cmd-I on MAC).
 4.   Graph limits can now also be set in the dgui.in file; see the DGUI UG for
      more details.

## MODIFICATIONS ##
 1.   The positioning and sizing of some windows and window elements has been
      slighlty modified in order to avoid text being clipped in certain cases
      of rendering the windows on full HD screens.

## CORRECTIONS ##
 1.   Pressing the "plot W,Phi" button did not result in a plot for the case of 
      a simulation that was done with just an RFQ. This has been fixed.

==================================================================================
## MODIFICATIONS ##
 1.   DGUI V1R0 was based on the DISLIN graphics package. DGUI V2R0 is a rewrite
      of V1R0, based on Python3.6, PyQt5 and pyqtgraph. On the surface it has 
      essentially the same look and feel as its predecessor, with some added 
      functionalities.
